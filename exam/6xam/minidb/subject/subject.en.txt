--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are provided with a Socket class and a Server class.

You must implement a very small key-value database server.

The program takes one argument: the port to listen on.

The server listens on 127.0.0.1.

When the server starts listening, it must print:
ready

Clients can connect using netcat.

The server must support the following commands:

POST <key> <value>
GET <key>
DELETE <key>

Responses:

POST:
- Always respond with: 0

GET:
- If the key exists, respond with: 0 <value>
- If the key does not exist, respond with: 1

DELETE:
- If the key existed and was deleted, respond with: 0
- If the key did not exist, respond with: 1

Each response must end with a newline.

When a client disconnects, the database must be saved to a file named ".save".
When the server starts, it must reload the database from this file if it exists.

The server must be non-blocking and handle multiple clients using select().

You must not modify the main function signature.
You must not change the provided class interfaces.

Memory leaks and file descriptor leaks are forbidden.
